This is the code for the night light I made for a Christmas 2017 gift exchange. It consists of a 
transulcent cylindrical shell surrounding a cylinder of Neopixels. The shell is attached to a rotary
encoder, which can be used to adjust the animations of the Neopixels. If you are interested in the
3D models used to print these parts, or in circuit schematics, let me know.
